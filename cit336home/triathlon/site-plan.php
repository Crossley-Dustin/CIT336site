                    <ul>
                        <li>San Quentin prison is a maximum security California state prison near San Rafael. Alcatraz Prison was a maximum-security federal prison, located on Alcatraz Island in San Francisco bay that closed in 1963. It has been decided that a triathlon between these two nefarious prisons would be a challenge for those who enjoy a challenge and attract history buffs as well. This particular race will be near Half Ironman, consisting of: a run of roughly 16 miles, a challenging swim of 3 miles and a scenic cycling course of 25 miles. The cost to enter is $100. The race will begin near San Quentin, run to Fisherman&#39;s wharf, swim to Alcatraz island and back and then bike around San Francisco bay, crossing the John T. Knox freeway and ending where the race began. This is a race between historic locales and unique in its scope.</li>
