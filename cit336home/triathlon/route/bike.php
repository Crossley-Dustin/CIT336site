                    Once you've run from San Quentin Prison and swam from Alcatraz, hop on your ride and put some distance from the prisons behind you. Cruise around San Francisco Bay, circling Treasure Island and passing by Oakland, Berkeley, Richmond.

                    If you've still got some gas in the tank, cross the John T. Knox freeway and finish the 25-mile bike route back where you started near San Quentin.
